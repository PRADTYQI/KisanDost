        <h1>Privacy Policy for KisanDost</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 27, 2025</p>
        
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how KisanDost ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Camera and Image Data</h3>
        <p>
            KisanDost requires access to your device's camera to provide plant disease diagnosis services. When you use the App:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The App requests permission to access your device's camera to capture images of plant leaves for disease diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Captured images are processed locally on your device using machine learning models (TensorFlow Lite). Images are analyzed in real-time to identify potential plant diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Images captured by the camera are processed temporarily in the device's memory and are NOT stored permanently on your device or transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly choose to save them.</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Upload:</strong> All image processing occurs locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or store your images on external servers or cloud services.</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Camera access is used solely for the purpose of plant disease diagnosis. We do not use camera data for any other purpose, including advertising or analytics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Your Control:</strong> You can revoke camera permissions at any time through your device's settings. However, this will prevent you from using the diagnosis feature of the App.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Google AdMob Data Collection</h3>
        <p>
            Our App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information to provide personalized ads and measure ad performance. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID), device type, operating system version, and device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with ads, including ad views, clicks, and interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location data (derived from IP address) may be collected for ad targeting purposes, unless you opt out through your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>App Information:</strong> Information about the App, including app version and installation details.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> Google's Advertising ID, which can be reset or disabled through your device's privacy settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Third-Party Data Sharing:</strong> AdMob may share collected data with third-party advertising partners and analytics providers. This data collection and sharing is governed by Google's Privacy Policy and the Google AdMob Program Policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Opt-Out Options:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resetting or disabling your Android Advertising ID in your device settings</li>
            <li>Using Google's ad personalization settings</li>
            <li>Installing ad-blocking software (though this may affect App functionality)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> AdMob uses collected data to display relevant advertisements and measure ad effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use aggregated, anonymized data to understand App usage patterns and improve user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> As described above, AdMob collects and may share data according to Google's privacy policies.</li>

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Processing:</strong> Since image processing occurs locally on your device, your plant images never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to save or share them.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
